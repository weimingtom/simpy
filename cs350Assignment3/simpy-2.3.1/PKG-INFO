Description: SimPy
        =====
        
        SimPy is a process-based discrete-event simulation language based on standard
        Python and released under the GNU LGPL.
        
        It provides the modeller with components of a simulation model. These include
        processes for active components like customers, messages and vehicles as well
        as  resources for passive components that form limited capacity congestion
        points (like servers, checkout counters and tunnels). It also provides monitor
        variables to aid in gathering statistics. SimPy comes with extensive plotting
        capabilities.
        
        The distribution contains in-depth documentation, tutorials, and a large number
        of simulation models.
        
        Simulation model developers are encouraged to share their SimPy modeling
        techniques with the SimPy community. Please post a message to the SimPy-Users
        mailing list: http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/simpy-users
        
        Software developers are also encouraged to interface SimPy with other Python-
        accessible packages, such as GUI, database or mapping and to share these new
        capabilities with the community under the GNU LGPL.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        SimPy requires Python 2.6 or above (including Python 3).
        
        You can install SimPy easily via `PIP <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_::
        
            $ pip install -U SimPy
        
        You can also download and install SimPy manually::
        
            $ cd where/you/put/simpy/
            $ python setup.py install
        
        To run SimPy’s test suite on your installation, execute::
        
            $ python -c "import SimPy; SimPy.test()"
        
        
        Getting started
        ---------------
        
        You can also run one or more of the programs under *docs/examples/* to see
        whether Python finds the SimPy module. If you get an error message like
        *ImportError: No module named SimPy*, check if the SimPy packages exists in
        your site-packages folder (like /Lib/site-packages).
        
        The tutorial and manuals are in the *docs/html* folder. Many users have
        commented that the Bank tutorials are valuable in getting users started on
        building their own simple models. Even a few lines of Python and SimPy can
        model significant real systems.
        
        For more help, contact the `SimPy-Users mailing list
        <mailto:simpy-users@lists.sourceforge.net>`_. SimPy users are pretty helpful.
        
        Enjoy simulation programming in SimPy!
